# 🏆 Score Keeper  

This project is a recreation of the **Score Keeper** app from Apple's Swift tutorial series.  
I followed the [Apple Developer Swift Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-data-modeling) to deepen my understanding of **data modeling, SwiftUI, and state management in Swift**.
